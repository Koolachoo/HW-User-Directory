* Several pages of the users can be cycled through from numbers on the bottom
* By clicking any of the top bars of the table, one can sort the table by that parameter, ascending or descending
* Using the drop down in the top left, the user can filter the whole table by people's first names
* The very bottom row can allow the user to quick jump to certain pages and decide how many names are shown at one time
